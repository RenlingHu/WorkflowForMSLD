# Workflow For MSLD

### Brief Intro.
 - A comprehensive, open-source, and automated workflow for MSLD Simulations based on BLaDE, from "Protein and Ligand Preparation" to "MSLD Simulations".
 - Our workflow not only **incorporated** all avaliable open-source components but also **included** the LIC-align algorithm for ligand preparation and the optimized MCS search algorithm for MTM creation, as well as scripts to flawlessly and robustly connect components.
 - Our workflow is set up in **modular way** to make it easier for various techniques to be combined and extended.
 - Our workflow **incorporated** the empirical strategies and specific considerations that are crucial for MSLD calculations. By utilizing default protocol and parameters, our workflow enables the acquisition of reliable results, even for inexperienced or exploratory participants.

### Overview
 - `Protein_and_Ligand_Preparation/` : (1) workflow for protein and ligand preparation; (2) Python/Jupter Notebook scripts for aligning ligands according to the MCS.
 - `Multiple_Topology_Creation/` : modified-Python scripts for creating multiple topology models of ligands and preparing input files needed in next stages.
 - `Simulation_System_Setup/` : CHARMM scripts and input files for setting up simulation systems.
 - `MSLD_Simulations/` : (1) Python and Shell scripts for running MSLD Simulations; (2) workflow for adaptive landscape flattening and production runs; (3) Python and Shell scripts for calculating relative binding free energies.

### Requirements
 - python 3.9.16
 - jupyternotebook 6.5.3
 - rdkit 2022.9.5
 - scipy 1.10.1
 - numpy 1.24.2

### Usage
 - There are details about how to use them in the corresponding README.md under each folder.

### Acknowledgement
 - Thanks to RyanLeeHayes and Vilseck-Lab for open-source scripts, corresponds to "Multiple Topology Creation" and "MSLD_Simulations" respectively.
 - This workflow is based on the scripts of the two, and the contributions of their lab to MSLD.
